    <b>In Dragon, A string is a data type, such as an integer and floating point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers. For example, the word "hamburger" and the phrase "I ate 3 hamburgers" are both strings. Even "12345" could be considered a string, if specified correctly. Typically, in Dragon, strings must be enclosed in double quotation marks for the data to recognized as a string and not a number or variable name and can be multiline. Escaping Unicode characters is also supported.</>
