    <h1>COMMENTS</h1>

    In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by
    compilers and interpreters. The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.
    Comments are sometimes processed in various ways to generate documentation external to the source code itself by documentation generators , or used for integration with source code management systems and other kinds of external programming tools .
    The flexibility provided by comments allows for a wide degree of variability, but formal conventions for their use are commonly part of programming style guides.
    <br>
    <h4>Dragon has two types of comments:</h4>
    In Dragon, Comments are generally formatted as either
    block comments (also called prologue comments or stream comments) or line comments (also called inline comments).
    
    <h3>1) Block comments:</h3> 
    Block Comments delimit a region of source code which may span multiple lines or a part of a single line. This region is specified with a start delimiter and an end delimiter
    For example, Dragon has block comments delimited by <mark>/*</mark> and <mark>*/</mark> that can span multiple lines.
    
    <br>
    
    <code style="color: green; font-size: large;"><pre>
    
    /*  This is a block comments, 
    and can span multiple 
    lines  */
    
    </pre></code>
    
    <h3>2) Line Comments:</h3>
    Line comments either start with a comment delimiter and continue until the end of the line, or in some cases, start at a specific column (character line offset) in the source code, and continue until the end of the line. Note that a line comments cannot span multiple lines. Line. comment can be repeated multiple time but cannot span multiple lines. 
    in Dragon, Line comment is delimited by <mark>//</mark> that can only span a single line. 
    
    <code style="color: green; font-size: large;"><pre>
    // Line comment 
    
    // Line comments can be
    // repeated multiple times
    // but cannot span 
    // multiple lines
    
    </pre></code>

        <span style="color: blue;">show</span> <span style="color: green; font-size: large;">/*inner comment*/</span> "Text"

    </code>
